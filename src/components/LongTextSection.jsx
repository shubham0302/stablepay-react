        <p>
          We are building a future of global remittance - Fair, efficient and
          secure way of transferring money from one region to another. We are
          starting with the radical idea that anyone, anywhere, should be able
          to easily and securely send and receive money at deserving rates
        </p>
        <p>A new way to remit funds globally, for a new generation</p>
        <p>
          As many of you know, we’ve embarked on a big mission: to ease global
          remittance and provide a better way for the next generation to
          transfer money globally. - Simplifying sending and receiving money
          globally
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, the average individual has to pay up to $35 per $500 USD money
          transfer in forex margins and transaction fees. We believe there’s
          something inherently wrong with that, and we’re on a path to change
          it. Our powerfully engineered technology and carefully designed mobile
          experience will allow sending and receiving money globally with no
          charges.
        </p>
        <p>
          We appreciate everyone’s lovely enthusiasm and patience as we gear up
          for a busy next few months. In the meantime, keep up with us on
          Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
        </p>
        <p>
          Cheers, <br /> Your friends at Stable Pay
